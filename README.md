![Zeta Prototype](/images/zeta-web.jpeg)

The Zeta is a minimal Z80 toggle-switch computer. It has a Zilog Z80 microprocessor, 256 bytes of RAM and the only interface is the front panel which directly sets and reads the address and data buses.

At the moment, there is only one source file in this repository, an Inkscape-produced SVG which contains the stripboard layout and lasercut paths along with the image for the box top. In the future I'll add a KiCad circuit diagram and maybe a Fritzing file with the stripboard layout in.

There are some errata in the current source - please see the issues section for details.
